<p>This page will tell you about the steps on becoming a janitor, and also how to make 
people very satisfied with your work.</p>

<p>To be a janitor you must take the job very seriously, or else you will disapoint all those toilets. Don't let them down, got it.</p>

<h3>

<a id="Getting Supplies" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Plunger and its history</h3>

<p>If you prefer to use a simple plunger BE CAREFUL!! Not everyone can handle the power that lies within the plunger Many have failed and only few have ever found success. One man named Mr.Tony was the first to ever find the power within the plunger.
he is also janitor of the month. and if you want to become a better janitor just follow his example.It is likely that the plunger was invented between 1850s and 1900s and at the time it wasn't very useful.</p>

<h3>
<a id="Duties" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What it means to become a legendary Janitor</h3>

<p> A person who cleans and maintains buildings such as hospitals, schools and residential accommodation. Janitors' primary responsibility is as a cleaner. In some cases they will also carry out maintenance and security duties. A similar position, but usually with more managerial duties and not including cleaning, is occupied by building superintendents in the United States. Cleaning is one of the most commonly outsourced services. Janitorial companies have a tendency to employ undocumented workers. The janitor has become a negatively stereotypical Black or blue collar character in popular culture.
  Another thing to look out for is our Janitors Hall of Fame (don't really have one, sorry) 
</p>

<h3>
<a id="support-or-contact" class="anchor" href="#support-or-contact" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Education Requirements</h3>

<p>Most people who want to become a janitor usually only need a high school diploma at times. No associate's, bachelor's, master's and doctor's degree needed or any computer science used while on the job.</p>
